### Why This Article is Interesting

Software engineering is not just about writing code; it also involves making ethical decisions that can impact society. The article linked above explores the ethical responsibilities of software engineers, and the importance of integrity, accountability, and transparency in the field.

What I find particularly compelling about this article is its discussion of real-world ethical dilemmas that software engineers may face, such as privacy concerns, data security, and algorithmic bias. As technology continues to shape the modern world, understanding these ethical considerations is crucial for developers who want to create responsible and fair software solutions.

I think your comment and article choice are interesting because it discusses an often overlooked aspect of software. Especially with the rise of AI, people are worried about the ethics behind the development and what the future holds because of it.

## Baba's Comment
First and foremost you did a fine job with your **README.md**. Additionally, I like the article you chose as I **also** believe that software engineers/developers, everyone basically, should have a moral compass when it comees to privacy, and the security of others etc.❗️
