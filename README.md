### Why This Article is Interesting

Software engineering is not just about writing code; it also involves making ethical decisions that can impact society. The article linked above explores the ethical responsibilities of software engineers, and the importance of integrity, accountability, and transparency in the field.

What I find particularly compelling about this article is its discussion of real-world ethical dilemmas that software engineers may face, such as privacy concerns, data security, and algorithmic bias. As technology continues to shape the modern world, understanding these ethical considerations is crucial for developers who want to create responsible and fair software solutions.

## Daniel Brito Comment

I think your comment and article choice are interesting because it discusses an often overlooked aspect of software. Especially with the rise of AI, people are worried about the ethics behind the development and what the future holds because of it.

## Stephen Spencer-Wong
I agree that we should put more consideration into the ethical dilemmas that software engineers face and how to approach them. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, recently recieved backlash for suggesting the need to rewrite the social contract to fit the future of AI. We have to be cautious of Silicon Valley billionaires attempting to rescript the social contract to their liking. In the world of software engineering and specially in AI, we ought to be more careful about the ethical considerations of the software we create especially around bias, privacy, and accountability.
